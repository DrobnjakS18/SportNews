<p>Rogerio Ceni has been appointed the new manager after resigning from his post at <a href="https://www.espn.com/football/team/_/id/6272/fortaleza">Fortaleza</a> and will take up his new position in Rio de Janeiro immediately.</p>

<p><strong>- Vickery: </strong><a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/flamengo/story/4231305/flamengo-unfairly-sacked-scapegoat-domenec-torrent-in-the-era-of-no-coaches"><strong>Torrent unfairly made scapegoat at Flamengo</strong></a></p>

<p>The former <a href="https://www.espn.com/football/team/_/id/2026/s%C3%A3o-paulo">Sao Paulo</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/football/team/_/id/205/brazil">Brazil</a> goalkeeper signed a contract until December 2021.</p>

<p>The move was made after Flamengo suffered two heavy defeats in their last three games.</p>

<p>"Domenec Torrent and his backroom staff are no longer in charge of the first team," the Rio de Janeiro club said in a statement.</p>

<p>Flamengo are third in the Serie A table, one point behind leaders Internacional, having lost just twice in the past 15 games.</p>

<p>They also won their group to qualify for the last-16 of the Copa Libertadores, a title they are defending after beating River Plate in last year\'s final.</p>

<p>However, a 4-0 defeat by second-place Atletico Mineiro on Sunday, coming a week after a 4-1 trouncing at home to Sao Paulo, prompted directors to act.</p>

<p>Torrent always faced a tough task trying to repeat the success of previous Flamengo manager Jorge Jesus, who had a spectacular one-year stay before leaving for <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1929">Benfica</a> in the summer. The Portuguese, who became an icon at the club, guided Flamengo to their first Brazilian first division title since 2009, their first Copa Libertadores since 1981 and a Rio de Janeiro state championship.</p>

<p>The 58-year-old Torrent had spent 10 years as Pep Guardiola\'s assistant at <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382">Manchester City</a> before managing NYCFC from June 2018 to November 2019.</p>

<p>Before joining Guardiola at Barca in 2007 he coached three clubs in Spain.</p>

<p>Liverpool remain within touching distance of the top but whether they will be there at the end depends largely on how quickly they can start keeping clean sheets. City, meanwhile, will rue <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134947/Kevin-De-Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a>\'s missed penalty at the end of the first half, leaving Pep Guardiola answering more questions about why his team are not scoring more goals.</p>

<p>Liverpool, without <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/157892/Virgil-van-Dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a>, are conceding too many and City, without <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/44927/Sergio-Ag%C3%BCero">Sergio Aguero</a>, are not scoring enough. Make no mistake, these are still England\'s best two teams, and whoever solves their issue first will be favourites for the title.</p>

<p>Perhaps crucially, Aguero is expected back after the international while Liverpool will have to cope without Van Dijk for many months yet. Remember, City could not cope when they lost <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/159317/Aymeric-Laporte">Aymeric Laporte</a> to injury last season.</p>

<p>The one problem they have got in common is the schedule, and it was noticeable that after an entertaining first half, the quality dropped after the break at the end of a long week that included Champions League commitments.</p>

<p>"I actually like the whole game, but the start was probably the best period," Jurgen Klopp said.</p>

<p>"That is how football is. Especially against City, you have to use your chances or create even more. For the football we played in that period, we didn\'t have enough. You just have to stay in the game. The energy level of both teams, it was a proper fight on the highest level."</p>

<p>The U.S. Women\'s National Team, co-captained by Megan Rapinoe, has been a symbol of gender equality ever since they filed a lawsuit in March 2019<strong> </strong>against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging pay discrimination.</p>

<p>Members of the women\'s soccer team earn significantly less than their male counterparts — despite the fact that their team has been more successful and more profitable. (The women\'s team has won four World Cup tournaments; the men\'s team has never won the World Cup.)</p>

<p>Rapinoe says that when it comes to pay equity, the U.S. is due for a "paradigm shift" in how we understand the value and potential of women.</p>

<p>"Men are so often paid and compensated on the potential that they show, not necessarily what they\'ve done," Rapinoe says. "And women are so often paid on what they\'ve actually done — which normally I would say, we outperform what our contract was."</p>

<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849492863/federal-judge-dismisses-u-s-womens-soccer-team-s-equal-pay-claim">dismissed</a> the claim in May 2020, but the team plans to file an appeal.</p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);">"The amount of money that [the women\'s team players] could possibly earn in our contract — compared to the amount of money that the men could possibly earn in the contract — is very different," Rapinoe says. "We\'ve been very successful ... and to get paid about the same dollar-for-dollar amount [as the men] — that\'s sort of at the heart of pay inequity and gender discrimination. "</span></p>',

<p>The Portuguese general prosecutor’s office revealed that nearly 30 searches were carried out on Monday by Judicial Police and the Tax Authority under the direction of the Public Ministry. All three clubs confirmed the searches, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica">Benfica</a> underlining their “total willingness to collaborate with the authorities”.</p>

<p>Sporting said in a statement the investigation is related to alleged irregularities from 2011-14 and congratulated the efforts to promote transparency in Portuguese football. Prosecutors said they were investigating “a range of cases, all linked to professional football, which could include crimes of economic participation in business or undue receipt of advantage, active and passive corruption, qualified tax fraud and money laundering”.</p>

<p>They added: “The investigation is also looking into the acquisition of sports and economic rights by players from national football clubs, loans granted to one of these clubs and to a sports company by a citizen of Singapore with interests in companies based in the British Virgin Islands and the use of accounts of the same club and another, for the circulation of money.”</p>

<p>According to reports by Portuguese broadcasters TVI, the Benfica president Luís Filipe Vieira<strong> </strong>is the main target of the authorities, with prosecutors also focusing on the transfer of three Libyan players who signed for Santa Clara. Real estate businessman Vieira was re-elected president of the 37-times Portuguese champions last month, extending a reign that began in 2003.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old is already facing a corruption trial alongside 16 other people, including three judges, and was also indicted in a tax fraud investigation targeting Benfica, who have also been implicated in match-fixing.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Varandas Fernandes, Benfica’s vice-president, told Rádio Renascença that Vieira is “relaxed” over the investigations. “President Luís Filipe Vieira remains calm and gives all his time to Benfica,” he said.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>“The processes are with the legal teams, the investigation has to be respected and we will collaborate as usual. Benfica fans can be confident that we will maintain the course that enabled us to get here with good financial, sporting and patrimonial results. Whatever the outcome of the process, it will prove the legality of all the procedures that have been used.”</p>',

                'content' => '<p>There hasn\'t been a trade in the NBA for almost nine months! Do you have the shakes? Let\'s take a look at the broader questions that will define the wild next month -- and maybe the next few years. How does a pandemic offseason unfold when almost every team is trying to win, limiting the number of sellers?</p>

<p><strong>The Giannis domino</strong></p>

<p>• Many within the Bucks remain confident <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> will sign a five-year supermax extension valued at between $220 million and $250 million (depending on the cap level) before the start of the 2020-21 regular season. Unless something drastic changes, Milwaukee is not trading him. If Antetokounmpo doesn\'t sign, the Bucks are prepared to play it out, sources have said.</p>

<p>As an aside, it\'s an interesting quirk -- one that disadvantages the Bucks -- that Antetokounmpo is not allowed to sign that same deal <em>during</em> the season. A huge subset of players can sign extensions (for below the supermax) in-season.</p>

<p>Antetokounmpo has already met supermax criteria, so there is no need to wait and see if he hits relevant benchmarks.</p>

<p>What if the Bucks start 30-5, and Antetokounmpo wants to commit?</p>

<p>Then again: What if the Bucks then disappoint in the playoffs? That\'s one intent of the rule: to give supermax-level players the most information before they decide. The league was also wary about supermax eligibility hovering over the season -- about superstars being asked if every win and loss impacts their thinking.</p>

<p>In any case, the Bucks will be active. They love <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a>, a restricted free agent with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a> who would require a sign-and-trade; the Bucks have kicked around scenarios in which they also absorb <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6578/harrison-barnes">Harrison Barnes</a>, sources have told ESPN. It is unclear if they have engaged the Kings in real discussions; it\'s early. (Acquiring any player in a sign-and-trade would trigger the hard cap.)</p>

<p>The Bucks are also eyeing Indiana\'s <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2527963/victor-oladipo">Victor Oladipo</a>, though no substantive talks with the Pacers have taken place, sources say. Other teams are monitoring the Oladipo situation, but several of them would like to see Oladipo in action before engaging Indiana, sources say.</p>

<p>Oladipo has struggled since his leg injury in January 2019, but he\'s only 28 and two years removed from an All-NBA season -- and on an expiring contract, which might deflate his trade value. If you don\'t give up too much now, letting Oladipo walk after the season (in the worst case) doesn\'t kill you. If Oladipo recovers 90% of peak form, any team that trades for him has a leg up on re-signing him (or extending him) through his prime.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a> had past interest in Oladipo, sources say, but they might have shifted into "wait and watch" mode. Oladipo would be an interesting fallback option as the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a>\' "third star," though I\'d be <em>very</em> surprised if Brooklyn dealt <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991043/caris-levert">Caris LeVert</a> for him.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> surprise me if Oladipo and the Pacers come back to the table on extension talks. (Oladipo can sign an extension at any point during the season.) Indiana can offer him a four-year deal starting at $25 million per season. I\'m not sure the Pacers would approach that number, but considering Oladipo\'s recent play -- and that some potential suitors, including the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a>, have likely backed away -- he would be wise to consider securing something.</p>

<p>• The broader issue is what Milwaukee can offer for Oladipo (or <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3995/jrue-holiday">Jrue Holiday</a>) -- something like <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4238/eric-bledsoe">Eric Bledsoe</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934673/donte-divincenzo">Donte DiVincenzo</a>, filler salary, and an extra first-round pick (or two) that will be low if Antetokounmpo stays. Bledsoe\'s trade value has cratered. The Pacers are probably not in any hurry to reunite the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2566769/malcolm-brogdon">Malcolm Brogdon</a>/Bledsoe backcourt; would Milwaukee have to find a three-team deal sending Bledsoe elsewhere?</p>

<p>The Bucks could sweeten the pot by trading lightly protected first-rounders further out -- picks that could become valuable (dangerously so from Milwaukee\'s perspective) if Antetokounmpo leaves.</p>

<p>• There has been no traction so far -- and maybe not even any talks -- on any deal sending <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> from the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> to the Bucks, multiple sources say.</p>

<p>• I don\'t know what Antetokounmpo is going to do, but I\'m on record betting against him signing the supermax this offseason. That said, as I told Bill Simmons <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=30149918">on the Lowe Post podcast last month</a>, there is value in locking in between $220 million and $250 million. Rivals will be able to offer Antetokounmpo a four-year deal worth between $140 million and $160 million. Antetokounmpo would make up some of that difference in his next deal -- but not all of it. The economic outlook is uncertain. Antetokounmpo can always sign now, and ask for a trade after a one-year waiting period.</p>',

They had just paid one of baseball\'s highest-profile stars, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts">Mookie Betts</a>, $365 million. And now their star, after expressing hesitancy in 2016 to kneel during the national anthem because of his father\'s military service in Vietnam, had changed his position.</p>

<p>"I wasn\'t educated," Betts said in July about why his stance changed. "That\'s my fault. I need to be educated on the situation. I know my dad served, and I\'ll never disrespect the flag, but there\'s also gotta be change in the world, and kneeling has nothing to do with those who served our country."</p>

<p>How would the team respond?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Dodgers/status/1286483621792997377">The organization backed him publicly</a> -- a purposeful move into politics that historically hasn\'t been a choice that sports franchises have been all that comfortable making. Image, the saying goes, is everything, and businesses have long been concerned about alienating customers. Yet the Dodgers\' move, like so many similar efforts seen in 2020 from throughout the sports industry, would seem to indicate a significant philosophical change that emanates right from the top of these organizations.</p>

<p>Not so much, at least by one measure: Campaign donations by owners to politicians and parties can be at odds with the public statements and actions of the teams they own. <a href="http://preview.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30155186/election-2020-political-donation-history-wealthy-sports-owners">According to an ESPN study of publicly accessible Federal Election Commission donation records</a>, owners of American pro sports teams have tended to support Republican politicians over their Democratic counterparts since 2015.</p>

<p>Looking closer over the past two years, owners in the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and NASCAR all donated significantly more money to the Republican Party than they did to Democrats. Among these leagues, owners in the NBA -- the league most often at the center of discussion regarding its overt messaging -- actually contributed the second-most cash to the GOP ($8.4 million), trailing MLB ($15.1 million).</p>

<p>The WNBA, a league that has been on the forefront of social activism in American professional sports, provides a clear example of perception vs. reality. The league is the only one of the six in ESPN\'s research with a liberal tilt, though it\'s small, with owners sending $1,634,153 (51.7%) to purely Democratic causes vs. $1,338,459 (42.3%) to Republicans. The conservative donations from the league as a whole come largely from a single source, Atlanta Dream co-owner and U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Georgia). She accounts for more than 65% of the WNBA ownership\'s GOP donations. (WNBA players have worn shirts reading "Vote Warnock" to support Raphael Warnock, one of Loeffler\'s opponents in her 2020 Senate race.)</p>

<p>"It appears there\'s no link between a league\'s image and the politics of its owners, or at least their political spending patterns," said University of California, Davis political science professor Ethan Scheiner, who studies the intersection of sports and politics.

<p>Round 7 had no shortage of competitive action, including three one-possession finishes. Real Madrid\'s 93-90 win over Zalgiris Kaunas at Zalgirio Arena was the highest-scoring of those affairs. After stumbling a bit out of the gate this season, Real has won the last two games against the second- and third-ranked teams in the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague standings.</p>

<p>In the matchup with Zalgiris – the EuroLeague\'s most efficient offensive team this season – Walter Tavares proved to be the difference for the visitors. The 2.20-meter center is one of the league\'s most unique players, for obvious reasons, and came through with one of the best efforts of his career in a key road win. When he can stay out of foul trouble, his ability to lock down the paint changes the calculus for opposing offenses. And when he\'s adding value on the offensive end the way he did against Zalgiris as a roller and rebounder, his impact on games is unmistakable.</p>

<p>Scoring 22 points and pulling down 12 rebounds in just 21 minutes of action, Tavares did not record a block, but that does not tell the whole story. Real allowed just 0.87 points per possession when he was on the court compared to 1.41 points per possession when he went to the bench. With opposing teams regularly challenging Real\'s other defenders by putting Tavares – who seldom leaves the paint – in the pick-and-roll, his presence is nothing short of polarizing and gave the EuroLeague\'s top offense fits last week.</p><p>Rim Protection</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><img src="https://sport-news.s3.amazonaws.com/post/images/stats.png" alt="stats.png"></p>

<p>It is not hard to see how players like Tavares change the game defensively, but it is not simple to evaluate how <em>much</em> they change it. There are a number of layers to how well a team protects the rim. Whether it\'s how many shots they block, how many they challenge, the percentage they allow opposing teams to convert, or the numbers of shots they discourage from being attempted entirely, there\'s a lot of things at play when measuring defense in the immediate area of the basket.</p>

<p>Real is a good example. While ranking eighth in points-per-shot allowed in finishing situations in half-court defense this season, Real doesn\'t really see many of those shots. In fact, only two teams see fewer such attempts around the basket. And when Tavares is on the floor, those rankings rise to fourth and first respectively. Overall, Madrid joins Fenerbahce Beko Istanbul, Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv, TD Systems Baskonia Vitoria-Gasteiz and Crvena Zvezda mts Belgrade as the teams successfully limiting both the quantity and quality of the shots that they allow around the rim in half-court situations.</p>

<p>Exactly one week after hoisting the women\'s singles trophy at the Australian Open, <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2746">Sofia Kenin</a> again stood in triumph with cheers cascading over her from an appreciative crowd.</p>

<p>This time, Kenin was not alone. On Saturday at a Fed Cup event in Everett, Washington, Kenin celebrated with her doubles partner, <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=497">Bethanie Mattek-Sands</a>. They had just stopped Latvia\'s <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2195">Jelena Ostapenko</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=756">Anastasija Sevastova</a> 6-4, 6-0 to give the U.S. a 3-2 victory. It was the decisive third match of a day that started with the Americans ahead two matches to none.</p>

<p>Just feet away, a U.S. bench featuring <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=394">Serena Williams</a>, teen sensation <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3626">Coco Gauff</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1765">Alison Riske</a> and team captain Kathy Rinaldi hugged and high-fived in jubilation.</p>


<p>The win punched the U.S. team\'s ticket to the new-look 12-team Fed Cup by BNP Paribas Finals to be played on April 14-19 in Budapest, Hungary. Like Davis Cup, Fed Cup has experienced a makeover, adopting a World Cup-style arrangement that will feature a round-robin format with four groups of three teams, followed by knockout semifinals and final over the course of one week.</p>

<p>This year, Fed Cup is also a precursor to the Tokyo Olympic Games, which are July 24 to Aug. 9. The competition offers the same daunting mix of opportunity and challenge as any other event in which national honor, not just individual accomplishment, is at stake. That\'s a mission the newest U.S. Grand Slam singles champion has embraced in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Kenin, who turned 21 in November, has appeared in just three previous Fed Cup ties, only one of them a win. She was thrown into the deep end as an 18-year-old in her first appearance, a final in Prague against a veteran Czech team. She lost a pair of three-set heartbreakers in the defeat for the U.S., but that didn\'t dim her enthusiasm.</p>',

<p>Instead, he reached his milestone at the Paris Masters amid a cathedral-like silence Wednesday in a 20,000-seat stadium left completely empty because of the coronavirus pandemic. There was only a fist bump from <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=426">Feliciano Lopez</a>, after Nadal beat him 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4 in a subdued atmosphere more worthy of a library study area than a sports arena.</p>

<p>"The real feeling, the personal feeling is completely different,\'\' Nadal said. "It makes a big difference that the court is empty.\'\'</p>

<p>The 34-year-old Nadal joins towering company in Jimmy Connors (1,274), <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425">Roger Federer</a> (1,242) and Ivan Lendl (1,068) as the only men in the 1,000-wins club since the Open era began in 1968.</p>

<p>"I know it is a very special number, one thousand,\'\' Nadal said. "Even if it\'s not the same to celebrate something like this without a crowd.\'\'</p>

<p>Nadal smiled as he posed at the net with the number 1,000 displayed on the court in a brief ceremony, and then he walked off center court like after any other match.</p>

<p>It was the second milestone he reached in Paris this year, having won the French Open last month to tie Federer with 20 majors. But while 1,000 fans cheered him at Roland Garros, none were at the Bercy Arena.</p>

<p>"Of course it\'s sad -- the level of energy is difficult to compare,\'\' Nadal said. "So the feeling, even if 1,000 [fans] or 1,500 or 2,000, is not a lot.\'\'</p>

<p>Nadal\'s first win came in May 2002 at the age of 15, when he beat Paraguayan <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1463">Ramon Delgado</a> in the first round at Mallorca.</p>

<p>A year later, the 16-year-old Nadal stunned the tennis world by beating French Open champion Albert Costa under floodlights in the second round at the Monte Carlo Masters.</p>

<p>By the age of 24, he had already reached 500 wins. His career tally also includes 35 Masters titles and 86 tournament victories overall.</p>',

<p>Townsend was in awe, but it was more personal. She had recently discovered she was pregnant. Still in the first trimester, she fought the urge to share her news with anyone outside of her tight-knit circle.</p>

<p>Kyrgios, who started seeing a psychologist in 2018, has been criticised by some for not caring enough about his tennis career.</p>

<p>"I felt like no one wanted to know me as a person, they wanted to get a hold of me as a tennis player and use me," Kyrgios told Stellar magazine. "I didn\'t feel like I could trust anyone. It was a lonely, dark place."</p>

<p>Kyrgios, 25, recalled a time he "didn\'t want to see the light of day" when in Shanghai.</p>

<p>"There are people who live and breathe tennis and that\'s fine. I\'m not saying that\'s wrong or right," he added. "I\'ve reached a level of freedom in my life that I really don\'t care what anyone thinks of me."</p>

<p>Kyrgios has received several fines for his on-court behaviour and was handed a suspended 16-week ban by the ATP for "aggravated behaviour" last year.</p>

<p>"I managed to stay really strong, be there all the time," the third-seeded Russian said. "Putting pressure on him all the time, raising my level step by step, and finally he broke.\'" Medvedev\'s style of play is unspectacular -- and not "wild" as Zverev put it afterward.</p>

<p>But what he does well is relentlessly chip away with flat, unerringly accurate strokes, punctuated by sudden accelerations of speed and whipped, fizzing forehands that always seem to land just in. Zverev, like many others before him, soon became exasperated and momentum quickly shifted.</p>

<p>"I\'m really trying to make my opponent crazy," Medvedev said with a wry smile in his postmatch interview. It was just his second win against the fourth-seeded Zverev in seven matches. His previous victory against the imposing German was also in a Masters final last year in Shanghai.</p>

<p>"I think it\'s not easy for guys to play against me when I play like this," Medvedev said. "Of course it\'s tough to compare with the Shanghai final, where I was on top of him all of the match. Here it was a really tight match where both could be the winners."</p>

<p>At least in the way they\'ve usually been fought.</p>

<p>As we approach a brand new generation of consoles, with Sony passing the baton from the PS4 to the PS5, and Microsoft succeeding the Xbox One with the Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft executive vice-president of Gaming Phil Spencer insists that the paradigm to look at this console generation is by how many people are playing video games, not a head-to-head comparison of console sales. The Series X/S are but a piece of the Microsoft offering, with a complete gaming approach across multiple devices, spearheaded by Microsoft Game Pass.</p>

<p>"I think our our pivot is really to build the best experience for players on the devices that they want to play on," Spencer told ESPN in an interview. "... I mean, so many of the things that we\'re doing now are available on different platforms. So for us in the gaming space, it\'s an approach to allow gamers to play the games that they want to play on the devices that they want to play on, and we think that\'s the best approach to growing Xbox."</p>

<p>Ths "family approach" strategy, which has been kicked into overdrive by Game Pass, has been a few years in the making. Spencer said that the Xbox leadership team has been planting the seeds since 2014 and has a focus to make games more accessible as a whole, not just to those that are willing and able to dish out $499 for the Series X or $299 for the Series S.</p>

<p>"If we\'re really going to be in the gaming space, shouldn\'t we be about all gamers?" Spencer said. "There are three billion people who play video games on the planet today, and there are about 200 million households that will buy a console. Console is an important consideration, but there are also a ton of people who play on PC. A ton of people play on the devices that they already own. I was really trying to expand our strategy to reach gamers on the devices that they want to play on, but also when we build a console to build absolutely the best console anyone could buy, and I think that\'s what the team is done."</p>',

<p>As its name indicates, Valhalla features a heavy dose of Norse mythology. It\'s a Viking saga that follows your character, Eivor, setting out from Norway in 872 CE to settle in England at a time when the Angles and the Saxons rule the land</p>

<p>Like the franchise\'s two previous games, Origins and Odyssey, Valhalla continues a trend toward becoming more of an open-world RPG game. It features a familiar storyline in which you will have to eliminate members of the shadowy Order and shares a lot of gameplay similarities with its immediate predecessors, but it also incorporates some interesting new features. It\'s a long game that I\'m still in the middle of playing, but after 20 hours of gametime, here are some takeaways.</p>

<p><img src="https://sport-news.s3.amazonaws.com/post/images/viking%202.jpg" alt="viking 2.jpg"></p><p>Customizing your experience</p>

<p>The start of the game provides many options for customizing your playing experience. Rather than choosing one level of difficulty for your gameplay, you can customize three different aspects. The first involves how difficult you want exploration to be -- that\'s basically about how much info you want displayed on screen to guide you in your missions and finding items. Regardless of how easy you make exploration, I still found it quite a bit harder than previous games when it came to finding items like loot chests and artifacts. It appears to be an intentional choice by Ubisoft to make exploration more challenging in general and make the entire world more immersive (more on that below).</p>

<p>The second level of difficulty determines your combat experience, with skald being the easiest and ranging up to vikingr, berserkr and the hardest level being drengr. The last aspect regards stealth. Do you want to easily walk past enemies or do you want it to be more challenging to evade their sight?</p>

<p>The other aspect of customization is choosing your gender. Like Odyssey, you can play as a male or female version of your character. Eivor was a woman in my playthrough, but not because I chose that. What\'s a little different about this game is that if you don\'t want to choose, you can just let the Animus decide your character\'s gender.</p>',

<p>DAMWON Gaming began their tournament as one of the favorites and entered the final by amassing a 34-3 record in the tournament heading into the clash against Suning. DWG finished first in their pool during the group stage en route to a dominant bracket stage performance, steamrolling fellow South Korean side DRX 3-0 in the quarterfinals before crushing Europe\'s top seed, G2 Esports, in the semifinals. In the decisive Game 4 victory over G2, DAMWON recorded the quickest victory in world championship history with a time of 19 minutes and 3 seconds.</p>

<p>The League of Legends World Championship is hosted by Riot Games, the developer of the game. Since 2011, with the inaugural seasonal championship in Jönköping, Sweden, the world championship final has become a worldwide phenomenon, selling out stadiums and arenas from Beijing\'s Beijing National Stadium to Staples Center in Los Angeles. Although no fans were permitted in attendance for the tournament before the last match, a lottery was held for more than 3 million hopefuls in China to select 6,000 socially distanced fans to attend the finale in Shanghai.</p>',

<p>Odoamne will replace Finn "Finn" Wiestål, who competed with Rogue throughout the 2020 season. Finn was often criticized by analysts and commentators as a weak link for Rogue due to a limited champion pool. Odoamne cannot sign with Rogue officially until Nov. 16 at 7 p.m. ET, the start of the 2020-21 League of Legends free-agency window.</p>

<p>Following their exit from the 2020 League of Legends World Championship, Rogue began negotiating with former Origen top laner Barney "Alphari" Morris, considered one of the best in his role in the LEC. Toward the end of his decision-making process, he narrowed it down to Rogue and Team Liquid, but <a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/30191573/sources-team-liquid-close-multi-year-deal-alphari">Alphari ultimately will sign with Liquid</a> on Nov. 16 after they offered a multiyear deal worth more than $1 million per year in total compensation, as reported by ESPN.</p>

<p>In their second year in the LEC, Rogue became one of the best teams in the league. The team finished first in the summer regular season, securing itself a spot at the world championship. There, they played in a group with DAMWON Gaming and JD Gaming, considered two of the best teams in the world. Rogue\'s went 1-5 at worlds, taking a game off Pacific Championship Series team PSG Talon.</p>

<p>Odoamne spent 2019 and 2020 as a part of Schalke 04 Esports, who despite an awful spring split this year rebounded at the end of the summer regular season, qualifying for the playoffs and finishing just one place shy of making the world championship. Schalke 04 will rebuild around jungler Erberk "Gilius" Demir and mid laner Felix "Abbedagge" Braun, although other members of that team may be brought back depending on how the remainder of the offseason shakes out, sources said.</p>',
